## 📌 Project Overview

E-commerce is one of the fastest-growing markets globally, but most platforms are designed for urban users. This project aims to change that by developing a **chatbot-assisted e-commerce platform** focused on rural communities. It provides a simple, multilingual interface, helping users explore and buy local products with ease.

The goal is to connect **village artisans, farmers, and small-scale producers** directly with buyers across India — boosting local economies and preserving cultural heritage.
